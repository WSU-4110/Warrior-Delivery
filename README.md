# Warrior-Delivery
A dining hall food delivery service.

Project Concept:

Current Issues:

Due to COVID, it is important to maintain safety on campus. Many students do not feel safe visiting high-risk locations such as dining halls. 
Current delivery options do not delivery directly to student.

Solution:

Create a service that can deliver food directly to any dorm or location on campus.

Project Description:
Our Website:

1. is available for students/faculty to order food and have it delivered anywhere on campus.

2. verifies the user is a Wayne State student based on access ID.

3. can specify the cafeteria and can support multiple menu items.

4. confirms order and displays delivery status for each user.
