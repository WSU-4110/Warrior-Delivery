## A Dining Hall Food Delivery Service.

### Project Concept:

- Current Issues:

1. Due to COVID, it is important to maintain safety on campus.
2. Many students do not feel safe visiting high-risk locations such as dining halls. 
3. Current delivery options do not delivery directly to student.

- Solution:

Create a service that can deliver food directly to any dorm or location on campus.

### Project Description:

Our Website:

1. is available for students/faculty to order food and have it delivered anywhere on campus.

2. verifies the user is a Wayne State student based on access ID.

3. can specify the cafeteria and can support multiple menu items.

4. confirms order and displays delivery status for each user.
