# Warrior-Delivery
##A dining hall food delivery service.

###Current Issues:
1. Due to COVID, it is important to maintain safety on campus.
2. Many students do not feel safe visiting high-risk locations such as dining halls.
3. Current delivery options do not delivery directly to student.
###Solution:
Create a service that can deliver food directly to any dorm or location on campus.
