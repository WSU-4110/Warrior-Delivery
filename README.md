### Current Issues:
1. Due to COVID, it is important to maintain safety on campus.
2. Many students do not feel safe visiting high-risk locations such as dining halls.
3. Current delivery options do not delivery directly to student.
### Solution:
Create a service that can deliver food directly to any dorm or location on campus. 

## Project Description:

This Website:
1. is available for students/faculty to order food and have it delivered anywhere on campus.
2. verifies the user is a Wayne State student based on access ID.
3. can specify the cafeteria and can support multiple menu items.
4. confirms order and displays delivery status for each user.
